Architecture & System Design Questions:
1. "In your SDK for emissions calculation, how would you handle fault tolerance and ensure data consistency when a webhook delivery fails? Design a robust retry and compensation mechanism."
- SDK Webhook Fault Tolerance:
"I would implement a robust event sourcing pattern with a message queue system like RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka. Each webhook event would be persisted in a database with states like 'PENDING', 'IN_PROGRESS', 'COMPLETED', or 'FAILED'. The retry mechanism would use an exponential backoff strategy with configurable retry limits. For example:
- Initial retry after 5 seconds
- Subsequent retries at 25s, 125s, etc.
- After max retries, event moves to a dead letter queue
- Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascade failures
- Provide a dashboard for manual intervention and replay capabilities"


2. "Your experience mentions handling 100k+ API calls daily. Design a complete system architecture that could handle 10x that load while maintaining sub-100ms response times. Include considerations for database choices, caching strategies, and load balancing."
- Scaling to 1M+ Daily API Calls:
"To handle 1M+ daily API calls:
Architecture:


Use API Gateway (like Kong) for rate limiting and auth
Multiple load balancers (nginx) in active-active configuration
Containerized microservices with auto-scaling (Kubernetes)
Read replicas for databases with write-through caching

Caching Strategy:

- Redis cluster for hot data
- CDN for static assets
- Implement cache warming for predictable high-load periods
- Use cache-aside pattern with TTL based on data volatility

Database:

- Partition data by tenant/date
- Use materialized views for heavy read operations
- Implement connection pooling
- Regular performance monitoring and query optimization"

3. "For your multi-user drawing tool, explain how you would handle concurrent edits to prevent conflicts while maintaining real-time responsiveness. What would be your conflict resolution strategy?"

Multi-user Drawing Tool Concurrency:
"I'd implement Operational Transformation (OT) or Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) for conflict resolution. Each drawing operation would have:


Unique identifier
Timestamp
User ID
Operation type and parameters
Vector clock for causality tracking

For conflict resolution:

Use intention preservation principle
Maintain operation history
Transform concurrent operations to achieve convergence
Implement LastWriterWins for simple conflicts
Use version vectors for complex state reconciliation"

Performance & Optimization Questions:
4. "You mentioned reducing page load times by 40% in your e-commerce work. Walk me through your complete performance audit process, specific optimizations implemented, and how you measured improvements. What tools and metrics did you use?"

5. "In your metaverse game, how would you optimize WebRTC connections for 100+ simultaneous users in a room while maintaining acceptable latency? What tradeoffs would you consider?"

Real-time Systems Questions:
6. "Explain your implementation of the delta-sync mechanism in your drawing tool. How would you handle scenarios where a client disconnects for 30 minutes and needs to resync with hundreds of changes?"

7. "Design a scalable pub/sub system for your real-time dashboards that can handle thousands of concurrent connections with minimal latency. How would you handle back-pressure?"

Technical Deep Dives:
8. "Implement a custom rate limiting middleware for Node.js that supports both IP-based and API key-based limits, with configurable time windows and burst allowances. Consider distributed scenarios."

9. "Design and implement a custom hook in React that handles complex canvas state management, including undo/redo functionality and real-time collaboration. Consider memory usage and performance."

AI Implementation Question:
10. "For your AI-based interview platform, explain how you would implement a real-time code evaluation system that can handle multiple programming languages, ensure security, and provide instant feedback. Include considerations for scaling and resource management."

Behavioral/Experience Questions:
11. "Describe the most challenging technical problem you encountered while building the property management system. What was your problem-solving approach, and what alternatives did you consider?"

12. "Your experience shows you've worked with both WebSockets and WebRTC. Compare and contrast scenarios where you'd choose one over the other, using specific examples from your projects."
